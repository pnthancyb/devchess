ðŸš€ Major Improvements:
1. Stockfish Engine Optimization
Extended difficulty levels: Now supports 1-10 levels instead of 1-5
Advanced evaluation: Implemented minimax with alpha-beta pruning
Transposition table: Added caching for better performance
Enhanced tactical detection: Fork, pin, skewer, discovered attack recognition
Deeper positional analysis: King safety, pawn structure, piece activity evaluation
Endgame optimization: Special evaluation for endgame positions
2. AI Chess Engine Enhancement
Extended difficulty range: Now supports 1-10 levels with detailed descriptions
Improved evaluation: Better material and positional assessment
Advanced minimax: Deeper search with alpha-beta pruning
Transposition table: Caching for performance optimization
3. Fixed Opening Learning Black Screen
Fixed React rendering error: The issue was caused by trying to render move objects directly in JSX
Proper move string conversion: Now safely converts move objects to strings before rendering
Enhanced error handling: Better validation to prevent rendering crashes
Improved move comparison: More robust comparison logic for opening moves
4. Extended Difficulty System
Stockfish (1-10):

Level 1: Random moves (beginner)
Level 2: Avoids blunders (casual)
Level 3: Basic tactics (amateur)
Level 4: Good positional play (club player)
Level 5: Strong tactical awareness (expert)
Level 6: Advanced strategic thinking (candidate master)
Level 7: Deep positional understanding (master)
Level 8: Near-perfect calculation (grandmaster)
Level 9: World championship level (super-GM)
Level 10: Maximum engine strength
AI Models (1-5):

Human-like play with creative strategies, capped at level 5 for natural gameplay
5. Enhanced UI Components
Updated AI model selector: Shows extended difficulty ranges with proper descriptions
Better difficulty visualization: Clear labels and color coding for each level
Model-specific information: Different max difficulties for different AI models
The system now provides a much more challenging and realistic chess experience with proper difficulty scaling from complete beginner to superhuman engine strength, while also fixing the critical rendering bug in opening learning mode.
